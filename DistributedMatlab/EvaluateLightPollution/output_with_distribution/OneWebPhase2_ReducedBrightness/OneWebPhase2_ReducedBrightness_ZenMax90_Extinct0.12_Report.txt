Evaluation ID: OneWebPhase2_ReducedBrightness
Number of constellation satellites = 6372
Number of constellation orbital shells = 3
Altitude(s) of constellation shells = 1200 km
Inclinations(s) of constellation shells = 40 to 87.9 km
MMT data path for analog satellites: data\MMT\OneWeb
Fraction of orbital shell 1 estimated to be brighter than SATCON-1 recommendation of 7.85 mag at zenith = 3.79%
Fraction of orbital shell 2 estimated to be brighter than SATCON-1 recommendation of 7.85 mag at zenith = 3.79%
Fraction of orbital shell 3 estimated to be brighter than SATCON-1 recommendation of 7.85 mag at zenith = 3.79%
Overall fraction estimated to be brighter than SATCON-1 recommendation at zenith 3.79%
Maximum observation zenith angle considered = 90 deg
Rule set used for  light pollution evaluation = 1 (medium stringency)
 
Overall light pollution level = 0.833 and light pollution risk = MEDIUM
 
RECOMMENDATION: Consider constellation redesign to mitigate the estimated MEDIUM level of light pollution risk
