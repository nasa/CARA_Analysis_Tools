Evaluation ID: OneWebPhase2_MeasuredBrightness
Number of constellation satellites = 6372
Number of constellation orbital shells = 3
Altitude(s) of constellation shells = 1200 km
Inclinations(s) of constellation shells = 40 to 87.9 km
MMT data path for satellites: data\MMT\OneWeb
Fraction of orbital shell 1 measured to be brighter than SATCON-1 recommendation of 7.85 mag at zenith = 65.7%
Fraction of orbital shell 2 measured to be brighter than SATCON-1 recommendation of 7.85 mag at zenith = 65.7%
Fraction of orbital shell 3 measured to be brighter than SATCON-1 recommendation of 7.85 mag at zenith = 65.7%
Overall fraction measured to be brighter than SATCON-1 recommendation at zenith 65.7%
Maximum observation zenith angle considered = 90 deg
Rule set used for  light pollution evaluation = 1 (medium stringency)
 
Overall light pollution level = 36.7 and light pollution risk = VERY HIGH
 
RECOMMENDATION: Constellation redesign recommended to mitigate the estimated VERY HIGH level of light pollution risk
